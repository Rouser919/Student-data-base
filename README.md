# Student-data-base
C++ 
In future I will add mysql base option to this project

Student data base could bd used for collect data about students. We can add, delete or modify students here. Moreover, there is a options to add,modify or delete marks of specify student. This program also calculate averages of subjects, search students and shows for specify name, surname, average and class. Another function is sorting students in data base by specify criterion. Additionally there is option to read data from files and save data base to a file. Besides, program will automate save data base to a specify file and sort by class raising.

I learned there some new things:
-How to properly use Lambda,
-How to use good smart pointers,
-How to create a project.

17.01.2021 Add base class with some definitions  Add functions to modify/erase/add marks

18.01.2021 Optimize functions, add main menu, functions to add to base or remove, add some menu options. (Update) Functions to write and read base from file, add functions to show all students. Tomorrow I plan bugfix this project and add new features.

19.01.2021 Bugfix all functions without read. (Update) Finish other functions(sorts,shows). Repair function write and read, bugfix other functions without sorts. Sorts I will bugfix tomorrow. In the next day I will probably finish projects with bugfix and other stuff.

20.01.2021 Almost done, bugfix functions, optimize, add new functions, add some validate and good looking. Sort is done

21.01.2021 Finish :)
